For this project, various tools and technologies were employed. Express Generator was used to quickly establish the initial structure of the Express server, simplifying the project's initial setup. 
Additionally, Node.js served as the runtime environment for the backend server. The chosen database was MySQL, managed through XAMPP, providing a local server environment for development. 
In MySQL, a database named "library" was created, where details of the books were stored, including their identification, name, and image URL. 
These technologies were integrated to enable the implementation of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system that manages book information, facilitating their creation, reading, updating.
